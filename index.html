				//at attr(), 2nd parameter refers to pre-set width at draw()
				var chart = d3.select(".chart").attr("width",width);

				//obs1: therefore x was previous defined using some chained methods, it refers to a scale. So a definiton
				//to domain is still desired, and is done above
				//obs2: domain is set as a range from 0 to the maximum value present at data. This last value is found by
				//executing the anon. f above, where d is a var. used to traverse all the data values
				x.domain([0,d3.max(data, function(d){return d.value;})]);
